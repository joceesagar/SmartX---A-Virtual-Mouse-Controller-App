# SmartX - A Virtual Mouse Controller App

**SmartX** is a mobile app designed to provide users with a virtual mouse controller that uses hand gestures to control the cursor on their computer. As part of the **SmartX Project** (a touchless motion controller for computers), the app enables seamless Bluetooth connectivity, real-time gesture recognition, and customizable settings for users to control their system without needing a physical mouse.

The app also provides an interface for users to manage the sensitivity of their gestures and configure their setup to suit their preferences.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Mouse Control**: Use hand gestures to move the cursor, click, and drag without a physical mouse.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Seamlessly connects to your computer over Bluetooth for wireless interaction.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects hand gestures through the deviceâ€™s sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) and translates them into mouse movements.
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection to control how responsive the app is to hand movements.
- **Setup Configuration**: Users can configure their gesture actions (e.g., mouse click, right-click, scroll) and fine-tune the app to meet their preferences.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with both iOS and Android devices for a broad range of use cases.
